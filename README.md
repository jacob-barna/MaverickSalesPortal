# MaverickSalesPortal
Undergrad Software Engineering Course Group Project - A sales portal written with PHP and AngularJS (group decision on the technologies).  This was the result of collaboration of 4 undergrad CS students at UNO including myself as the tech lead.

IMPORTANT: Because this was just a school project, we did not spend time setting up certificates, etc.  This code is for illustration purposes only.
